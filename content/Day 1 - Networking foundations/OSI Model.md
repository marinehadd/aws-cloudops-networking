Each layer has a meaning in networking. We will not cover the layers in depth, but you can read more about in the [Further Reading](/further_reading.html) section.

Networking is based on the OSI model, it is a bit like the layers of a cake, often referred as L1, L2, L3, etc..

Let's pick some real life examples:

- L1 = a router, a switch, a cable, anything physical

- L2 = a switch, a MAC address

- L3 = a router, an IP address

- L4 = online streaming

- L5 = when you connect to an application

- L6 = when you used Putty to login to your EC2 instance during Linux CloudOps workshop

- L7 = an application
